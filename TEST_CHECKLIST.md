# 🧪 Marketly Test Checklist

## Current Status: Phase 0 + Phase 1 (UI Only)
The app is currently configured to run **without Supabase** for testing the UI and navigation.

## ✅ Test These Features:

### 1. **Navigation & Layout**
- [ ] Visit `http://localhost:3000` - Landing page loads
- [ ] Navbar shows "Marketly" logo and navigation links
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Clean, minimal design matches requirements

### 2. **All Routes Work**
- [ ] `/` - Landing page with hero section and product grid
- [ ] `/login` - Login form with email/password fields
- [ ] `/signup` - Signup form with clean design
- [ ] `/reset-password` - Password reset form
- [ ] `/account` - Account settings page (shows mock data)
- [ ] `/purchases` - Purchase history page (shows mock data)
- [ ] `/admin/products` - Admin dashboard (shows mock data)

### 3. **UI Components**
- [ ] **Buttons** - Different variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
- [ ] **Cards** - Clean card components with headers/content
- [ ] **Inputs** - Form inputs with labels and proper styling
- [ ] **Forms** - All forms are properly styled and accessible

### 4. **Design System**
- [ ] Consistent typography and spacing
- [ ] Proper color scheme (neutral with good contrast)
- [ ] Hover states and focus indicators work
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] Clean, minimal aesthetic

## 🚧 What's NOT Working Yet (Expected):
- ❌ **Authentication** - Forms don't actually sign you in/up
- ❌ **Real Data** - All data is mocked/placeholder
- ❌ **Token Balance** - Shows static 500 tokens
- ❌ **Database** - No real database connection
- ❌ **Protected Routes** - All pages accessible without login

## 🔧 To Enable Full Functionality:
1. **Set up Supabase project** (see SETUP.md)
2. **Add environment variables** to `.env.local`
3. **Run database schema** in Supabase SQL editor
4. **Re-enable authentication** (uncomment imports in auth pages)

## 🎯 What to Look For:
- **Clean, professional design**
- **Fast loading times**
- **Smooth navigation between pages**
- **Responsive layout on all screen sizes**
- **Accessible forms and buttons**
- **Consistent styling across all pages**

## 🐛 Report Issues:
If you find any visual bugs, layout issues, or broken links, let me know and I'll fix them immediately!

**Next Phase**: Once you're happy with the UI/UX, we'll set up Supabase and enable real authentication + database functionality.
